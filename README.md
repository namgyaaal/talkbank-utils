# Talkbank Utils 

Python utility library for handling text and audio of Talkbank `.cha` files made for personal use. 

Used on ASR tasks (voice recognition, diarization and speech-to-text) for libraries such as `pyannote-audio` and `nemo_toolkit[asr]`. Because of this, it ignores a lot of other data included in .cha files. 

If you want those features, consider using other libraries (such as `pylangacq`).
